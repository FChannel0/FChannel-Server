      <h4>What is fchan</h4>
      <p>fchan short for fchannel and is a federated image board based on activity pub. it removes the need for centeralized boards. many boards can be connected and feeds shared or followed. it draws likeness from other chans for ease of familiarity. you can get the source code here https://github.com/FChannel0 and modify how you choose, any help is appreciated.</p>

      <h4 id="options">Options</h4>
      <p>the options field when posting can be used for special options when posting. type noko in the options field to return to the thread you posting to. use sage to ignore updating the thread bump order. nokosage will do both.</p>

      <h4 id="tripcode">Tripcode</h4>
      <p>you can identify yourself with a tripcode by adding a hash mark (#) after your name followed by your unique identifying string, example anon#myunique.</p>    

      <h4 id="quote">Quote</h4>
      <p>use a greater than symbols (>) to quote strings of text. use double (>>) followed by the url id of the post you are referencing (this will be changed later for better use).</p>

      <h4 id="link">No. Link</h4>

      <h4 id="javascript">JavaScript why?</h4>
      <p>a version of the client with no javascript will be made eventually. current version requires it, because of basic functionality needed. no libraries or frameworks for javascript is used besides ECMAScript, just basic selection of DOM elements and modifying their styling. maybe someone would be willing to make a client that uses no javascript.</p>            

      <h4 id="seqnum">Why are the posts not sequential numbers?</h4>
      <p>sequential numbers have run their course. random base 16 (now base 36) is better.</p>

      <h4 id="version">Server Version</h4>
